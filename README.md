# loop-hero-script-mods
A Loop Hero mod that changes the script to be gender neutral or gender flipped in different scenarios. 

I may add more script mods as time goes on, if people are interested.  Feel free to dm me if you want to do stuff like that, or for other translations

HOW TO INSTALL

ON WINDOWS:
1) Download the ini file of your choice
2) Go to the game on steam
3) Right click, go to manage, and click Browse Local Files
4) Open the Local directory, and then replace the file called lang_eng with this file.  Your new file should completely replace lang_eng.ini
5) Boot up the game, that's it

ON OTHER PLATFORMS:
I don't know how this game installs on mac/linux, if it's the same way. Would appreciate someone checking? Let me know if this works on other platforms. 

HOW TO UNINSTALL: Either click on the game, go to properties, go to the local files tab, and then click "validate local files", or just replace the lang_eng.ini file with a copy of the original.

OTHER LANGUAGES:  I only speak english, but if anyone wants to volunteer to do the same thing with other translations, please go right ahead.  There isn't that much gendering in english, not sure how much there would be in other translations.
